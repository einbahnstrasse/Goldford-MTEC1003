<a id="descr"></a>  
### II. Course Description  
MTEC1003 examines the fundamental topics, tools, skills, and best practices that support creative programming. At its core we ask how the user can gain finer control over their computer and make better use of it in their personal practice. Through our weekly lab assignments, demonstrations, and supplementary resources, students will gain fluency with the tools necessary to construct websites, using essential front-end technologies such as HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Additionally, students will implement fundamental programming paradigms in JavaScript and Python, and will harness the computer's powerful administrative functionality on the Unix command line. We will organize our workflow intelligently with source code management (i.e. Git). Our work prepares the student for subsequent classes in the MTEC course rotation. Time permitting, we will also touch on the basics of data mapping for artistic purposes.

In this semester's online version of MTEC1003, and in lieu of a physical classroom, we will rely on a few of the interactive coding tools available to us as distant learners — for example, some of our tutorials will be completed on Google Colaboratory, and we will heavily utilize Slack for essential course communication. We may also use OpenLab for some correspondence.

Students will therefore be **required** to (1) set up and join our course's Slack channel, (2) set up and maintain a public _GitHub_ user account for all submitting assignments, and (3) download/install all required software on their own computer (from the [RESOURCES TAB](/Goldford-MTEC1003-OL78/resources.html){:target="_blank"}).

* * *

<a id="goals"></a>
### III. Course Goals
* Introduce the Unix command line, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Python.
* Define and execute basic control flow operations: functions + function calls, loops, conditional statements, etc.  
* Utilize version control for intelligent backup, with special emphasis on Git.
* Submit all course assignments through _GitHub_.
* Create personal web content using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using _GitHub Pages._  

* * *

<a id="outcomes"></a>
### IV. Learning Outcomes
_By the end of the course students will be able to:_
* **Build + Execute** simple programs in JavaScript and Python.
* **Read** and understand documentation and resources related to our programming languages.
* **Interface** with (1) your computer's administrative capabilities, (2) Git, and (3) Python, using the Unix command line.
* **Understand** fundamental programming operations (i.e. those listed in III. Course Goals, above).
* **Establish** a creative coding practice that includes a logical debugging process.
* **Organize** all developmental work using version control (Git) via a personal _GitHub_ account.
* **Create + Publish** an original website from basic HTML/CSS formatting and JavaScript.  

* * *

<a id="resources"></a>
### V. Required Software + Other Resources  
_See the [RESOURCES TAB](/Goldford-MTEC1003-OL78/resources.html){:target="_blank"} for download and documentation links._  
* Terminal (macOS) or an acceptable Terminal Emulator (Windows)  
* an acceptable Text Editor (e.g. Atom, Sublime Text 3, or Visual Studio Code)  
* Google Chrome  
* Git (and Homebrew for Git installation)  
* a public account on _GitHub.com_
* Python 3  

* * *

<a id="expect"></a>
### VI. Expectations  
#### VI. Part I. General Expectations  
* **Arrive on time** to all online course sessions. — _See Attendance + Participation Policy below._
* Setup + maintain a public _GitHub_ account, and report your username to the instructor for grading at the start of the semester.
* Spend **1-2 additional hours a week** _(outside of class)_ on the timely completion of our lab assignments and projects.
* Submit assignments by the given deadlines: typically **on the Saturday night following class.**
* **Back up and organize your work REGULARLY on _GitHub_.** _Catastrophic loss of materials is no excuse for missed deadlines!_

#### VI. Part II. Special Note About Readings + Slides
* **Study the slides and tutorials ahead of class. Come prepared with questions if you don't understand them.** You will need to understand these materials and the examples given each week to be able to complete our weekly lab assignments.  
* **We will likely be unable to present slides in class. You are therefore responsible for familiarizing yourself with this content even if we don't cover it in our session.** Our class is a "lab", meaning we will devote the majority of our time to rapid demonstrations and especially to completing the lab exercises themselves.
* Additionally, you are strongly encouraged to **consult the recommended documentation resources** found in our schedule. These provide context, will deepen your understanding, and will pay dividends in your coding this semester and far beyond...

* * *

<a id="comm"></a>
### VII. Communication
* Weekly course sessions will be held on Zoom. Use the recurring virtual Zoom classroom link emailed to you at the start of the semester.
* City Tech email accounts are our official means of communication, but we will also use Slack and OpenLab for additional discussion.  
* **Requests to the instructor for assistance:** Send an email, or a message on Slack. I will respond during normal working hours; requests arriving "after hours" will be answered on subsequent weekdays.  
* [Professional communication etiquette](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/professional-email-salutations){:target="_blank"} is expected in our written correspondence. In emails and messages, this includes polite and appropriate salutations, greetings, and courtesies.  
* **Virtual office hours are available through my Calendly link** _(see I. Essential Course + Contact Information, above)_. If you are frequently missing from class discussion, missing lab assignments, or demonstrating poor comprehension of our materials, **I may occasionally require office hours visits with you, in which case I’ll send you a message through Slack or in an email. It is my expectation that you respond promptly and sign up for a time** to discuss any such perceived issues, and failure to do so will be reflected in negative participation points.  
* Slack should be used during regular hours. Please respond during the workday as promptly as you can to inquiries from the instructor (both for email and messages sent on Slack). _Multiple successive days without a response is unacceptable._
* **Actively participate** in our online class discussions. **Thoughtfully contribute to a positive classroom environment,** while supporting and challenging your colleagues’ ideas.
* **Check Slack regularly** for group and private messages.
* If you have a question that may be relevant to the group (about assignments, etc.), post in the #general channel on Slack.
* Use Slack for easy communications with your classmates as well — you can DM individuals or selected groups.

### IX. Attendance + Participation Policy
_Participation is based on attendance and your engagement on Zoom, and will form a substantial portion of your grade._

#### IX. Part I. Virtual Participation on Zoom  
* You will be encouraged but not required to share your video connection for the duration of each class. You will be called upon to share your audio and screen-sharing connections, which remain required (for asking/answering questions, demonstrating your work, troubleshooting your code, etc). Failure to unmute your Zoom microphone and respond within 15 seconds of being called upon will be considered an absence from class, and will result in lowered participation scores for the day. Technical difficulties are no excuse (see policy regarding internet connection below): you should test your connection before class, and if there are any problems, they must be reported in advance.   
* If you choose not to share your video, your engagement and presence must still be felt through your active participation in other manners: e.g. responses to prompts and questions, offering possible solutions and perspectives where appropriate, etc.  
* Find a quiet and presentable space that you don't mind sharing through your Zoom audio (and possibly video) connection. You can also choose a virtual background within Zoom settings if you want to share your video but need to preserve the privacy of your space.  
* In lieu of a video sharing attendance requirement, you will complete weekly online quizzes as part of your participation grade during our allotted class time. These quizzes usually take about 15-20 minutes to complete and will begin promptly at the start of each class. Therefore, your prompt arrival at 2:30 ensures that you have the full amount of time to demonstrate your participation. Each quiz is worth a variable number of points each week and is entirely based on our slides and other materials located under the SCHEDULE TAB of our Course Website, as well as issues that may have arisen during our previous class discussions.  
* The topic(s) of each quiz may review the previous week’s materials or may include questions on the upcoming topics of the current week. Therefore, you will need to take notes and study in advance of each class, fully prepared to finish these quizzes in a timely manner. Failure to complete each quiz within the allotted time will result in a loss of participation points and will negatively affect your course grade.  
* Additionally, each quiz will conclude with a passphrase given verbally by the instructor over Zoom at a random time during the class session. You will be unable to submit your weekly quiz for participation points until you submit the correct passphrase at the end. You must remain present and alert in class in order to receive the correct passphrase.  Do not repeat the passphrase once it’s been given by the instructor.  
* Utilize Zoom's chat and hand-raising features for interacting with the instructor or the class. Occasionally you will be prompted to answer questions, so these tools are essential.  
* For questions about using Zoom and its features, consult the [Zoom Help Center.](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us){:target="_blank"}    
* Test your internet connection on the day of class before it's too late. If you are suddenly experiencing connection problems that prevent you from joining one of our sessions on time, send me a Slack message immediately, and an email later if necessary. Further information about our Attendance Policy appears below. Failure to proactively troubleshoot long-term connection problems (and/or to communicate with the instructor about them) will be problematic for your participation score.  
* Avoid distractions from social media and unrelated gaming or web content. Strive to engage fully during our dedicated class time. We only meet on Mondays, so it will be difficult to recoup the losses of not paying attention later in the week, e.g. while finishing assignments.  
* Typically we will take a short break about midway through class. If you need additional time for restroom breaks or emergencies, quietly and occasionally excuse yourself by muting your video and audio on Zoom. However, frequent and recurring self-excusals will reflect negatively on your engagement in our class and result in lowered participation scores.  
* Failure to comply with these policies will result in a lowered participation score. I grade holistically, but will not be curving your scores when long-term participation issues persist.  
* There is no extra credit in MTEC1003. Therefore, plan accordingly.  
* Certain demonstrations in class may be recorded for anyone in need of an asynchronous learning option, but in general we do not record weekly lectures. Any such videos will be made available temporarily through our Course Slack page, but will never be posted publicly.  
* Bear in mind that you will be doing exercises on your computer at the same time we're discussing and presenting examples on Zoom. Locate an easy way to rapidly switch between the application windows open on your desktop, e.g. between Zoom and your Terminal, Text Editor, and/or Chrome. On macOS, for example, this is easily accomplished by holding down the `Command` key and pressing `TAB` key to switch between applications.  

<a id="arrival"></a>
#### IX. Part II. Prompt Arrival and Absences
* Students are expected to arrive promptly to all virtual class sessions, stay online and involved through the duration of each session, participate and engage in our labs, discussions, and demonstrations.  
* Follow this **Procedure for Absences:**
	* Contact a classmate for notes on what you missed (e.g. on Slack).
	* Check our Course Website for assignments, slides, tutorials, recommended documentation reading, etc.
	* After these first 2 steps, contact the instructor with any additional questions.
* **Excused absences/lateness must be accompanied by documentation** and/or include advance notice with the instructor where possible. Excused absences/lateness will not impact on your grade. Absences may be excused in cases of: documentation of illness provided by a doctor, religious observance with advance notice, official school-related activity (always with documentation and advanced notice), and on a case-by-case basis for other critical events, at the discretion of the instructor.
* _A lack of communication with the instructor about planned absences will therefore be treated as UNEXCUSED. Be in touch early._
* **Unexcused absences and lateness will result in lowered participation grades.** Prompt arrival online earns you an immediate 5 points (i.e. 1/2 of your full participation). For arrivals after 2:30 PM, the following weighted score system applies:

<div class="latetable">

<div class="instructornote">
<p markdown="span"><em>Additionally, three (3) unexcused absences will <b>lower your participation score by 34 points</b>, which is equivalent to a 10% reduction of your Course Grade (i.e. one letter grade).<br />Each additional unexcused absence beyond 3 will further lower your participation score by <b>17 points</b>, or the equivalent of 5% increments in your Course Grade.</em></p></div>

### X. Academic Integrity Policy
#### Part I. General Notes on Academic Integrity
Students and all others who work with information, ideas, texts, images, music, inventions, and other intellectual property owe their audience and sources accuracy and honesty in using, crediting, and citing sources. As a community of intellectual and professional workers, the university recognizes its responsibility for providing instruction in information literacy and academic integrity, offering models of good practice, and responding vigilantly and appropriately to infractions of academic integrity. Accordingly, academic dishonesty is prohibited in The City University of New York and at New York City College of Technology and is punishable by penalties, including failing grades, suspension, and expulsion. The complete text of the College policy on Academic Integrity may be found in the catalog.

<div class="instructornote">
<p markdown="span">**Instructor Note:** _Code borrowed from another source must be attributed as a comment within your own code. If you are unsure of whether or not your work may constitute plagiarism, please check with the instructor before submitting. Where applicable and where marked within our course materials, follow the provisions of the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/){:target="_blank"}_</p>
</div>

<a id="integrity-pledge"></a>
#### Part II. Academic Integrity Pledge
_By enrolling in this course, you pledge to uphold the policy on Academic Integrity described below:_  

I understand the value of personal integrity and ethical behavior in all aspects of my professional and personal life. By committing to honesty and personal responsibility, I earn the respect and trust of others. As a student at New York City College of Technology, I recognize that the value of my education is not just being able to say I am a college graduate, but it also incorporates the skills, values, and knowledge I have acquired. I thus commit myself to upholding academic integrity as an important aspect of my personal integrity and professional growth. I understand that academic integrity includes:  

1. Fully observing the rules governing exams and assignments regarding resource material, electronic aids, copying, collaborating with others, or engaging in any other behavior that subverts the purpose of the exam or assignment, and the directions of the instructor.   
2. Only turning in work that I have done myself, and not using unattributed work done by others. While working and studying with others can be an effective way to learn, submitted work will be my own.  
3. Giving full and proper credit to sources and references, and acknowledging the contributions and ideas of others, in my academic work.  

Further, I have read and understand the college’s [Academic Integrity Policy found in the New York City College of Technology College Catalog, p. 56 of the spring 2020 catalog.](http://www.citytech.cuny.edu/catalog/docs/catalog.pdf#page=56){:target="_blank"}

<a id="inclusivity"></a>
### XIII. Inclusivity  
#### XIII. Part I. Name + Pronoun Usage
This course consists of individual work and group discussion. We must therefore strive to create an atmosphere of inclusion and mutual respect: all students will have their chosen gender pronoun(s) and chosen name recognized. If the class roster does not align with your name, gender, and/or pronouns, please inform the instructor.  

#### XIII. Part II. Inclusivity Statement  
_It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as an asset, resource, strength, and benefit, rather than a checklist item or worse, a hindrance. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups. Feel free to reach out to me via email at any time about any issues concerning you or with any such ideas._
