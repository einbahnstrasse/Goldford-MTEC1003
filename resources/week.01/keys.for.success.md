# ProTips for Success in MTEC1003  
## What To Do IN Class   
* Watch + Listen to slides, tutorials, and demonstrations.  
* Take notes throughout, especially noting where anything is confusing.  
* Work through the steps of each example alongside the instructor (code it on your computer as we're going!)  
* When something doesn't work on your computer, **Ask Questions.**  
* Don't be shy or embarrassed about asking for clarification...  
* Seriously, computers are just weird, and they always "throw errors." Even the most seasoned pros deal with errors on a daily basis! _And usually, it's not obvious where the error is coming from!_   
* Ultimately, if you can't solve the problem in class, follow up by sending the instructor an email, or ask about an office hour appointment to finish solving the problem at another time.  

## What To Do AFTER Class    
* If some stuff is unfinished at the end of class, finish them by the deadline.
* Test your work using the Google Chrome console (if using JavaScript, HTML, CSS), or on the command line (e.g. if working on a Python script). Be sure it works, or work the problem.
* If it doesn't work, there are some things you can do to troubleshoot:
  * Read the errors in the Chrome console or in Terminal. It will tell you which line of code to check.
  * Try coding something new on the lines causing the error. If you can't figure it out...
  * Consult the slides and references given in class.
* If you still haven't found the answer, email the instructor explaining the situation _early in the week!_  
* **Don't wait until the night before class to ask.** Give yourself time to work on the solution.
* Be sure to _COMMIT_ and _PUSH_ your work using our GIT commands before the deadline.
* **If you forget these steps, you haven't "turned in" your work on GitHub and won't receive credit!**
* If everything seems to be working, check your GitHub page to be sure your most current changes (i.e. "commits") are visible online. Your grade comes from what you put on GitHub; not what is on your local computer.
* If you're unsure whether the work is visible on GitHub, you can always email the instructor during the week to make sure they can see your labs.
